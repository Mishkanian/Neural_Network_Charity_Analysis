# Neural Network Charity Analysis

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by a fictional company "Alphabet Soup." The data is preprocessed for a Neurnal Network Model

## Software and Resources

#### Optimization Attempt 1

![attempt1](https://github.com/Mishkanian/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/blob/main/README_Images/attempt1_accuracy.png)

In the first attempt to optimize this model, the number of neurons in the hidden layers were increased.

#### Optimization Attempt 2

![attempt2](https://github.com/Mishkanian/Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis/blob/main/README_Images/attempt2_third_layer_accuracy.png)

In the second attempt, a third hidden layer was added to the model with 4 neurons

#### Optimization Attempt 3
